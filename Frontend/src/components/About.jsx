        <p className="about-desc">
        Welcome to <span >Lost and Found</span>, a project developed by the <span>Tigers </span> team, students from the 3rd year of <span>SDU University </span>, as part of our Project Management course. At Lost and Found, we recognize the stress and frustration that comes with losing something valuable. Whether it's a treasured pet, an important document, or a necessary gadget, the impact of losing an item can be overwhelming.

Our goal is simple: to provide a platform where people can share information about lost and found items, fostering a sense of community and support. By coming together, we believe we can improve the chances of reuniting lost items with their rightful owners. Join us in making the process of reconnecting with cherished possessions easier and more efficient.
